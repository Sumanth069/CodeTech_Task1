This project demonstrates file handling in Java using a menu-driven approach and separate classes.

The program allows users to create, read, write, and append a text file through console-based interaction.

Menu Options

1.Write to File -> Creates a new file or overwrites existing content
2.Read File -> Displays file contents
3.Modify File -> Appends data to the existing file
4.Exit -> Terminates the program
